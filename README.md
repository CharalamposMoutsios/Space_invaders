Extra

    the game is still on progress, i need to find smaller png files for the spaceship,enemy and bullet, also the sound is not perfectly fit to the game, but i was just testing it. 
    So definetely needs more development in order to have a nice looking and sound game like the classic space invaders from the old-school atari =)
